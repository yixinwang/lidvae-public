# Empirical studies of LIDVAE on images

This folder contains the implementation for Section 4.1 of the paper,
illustrating LIDGMVAE on image datasets.

To run this study, run `src/run_fit_idgmm_sweep.sh` which fit LIDGMVAE
to different datasets.

The `res/` folder contains some sample output files from fitting
LIDGMVAE (after only a few epochs).
